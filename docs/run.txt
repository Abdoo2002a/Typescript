you can`t run typescript in browser , you have to transpile to javascript , to run it.

by doing this
tsc nameOfTheFile.ts  this will create a new javascript file , this process called --> transpile <--


but you will have to run this command every time to transpile it

or just type

tsc nameOfTheFile.ts -w

example 

tsc main.ts -w
